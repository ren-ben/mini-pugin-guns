# Basic Premise🪄

---

The Plugin, as I have already states isn't really for public use I just made it to train my skills a bit.

The Player will be given a command to weaponize certain Tools with certain Projectiles.

- Diamond Hoe launches Fireballs

- Iron Hoe launches XP Bottles

- Diamond Shovel launches Ender Pearls

- Iron Shovel launches Snowballs

- Diamond Sword launches Tridents

- Iron Sword launches Arrows

# Usage💡

---

Type `/w` to weaponize all the Tools

You can also specify which one you'd like, for example `/w iron_shovel`

Here's a list of all the specific tool arguments:

- `diamond_hoe`

- `iron_hoe`

- `diamond_shovel`

- `iron_shovel`

- `diamond_sword`

- `iron_sword`

You can also use `/w rm` to remove de-weaponize all tools

This project is actually a challenge from [This Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/develop-minecraft-plugins-java-programming/) on Udemy made by Stephen King, all credit for the initial idea goes to him, although I've added some extra features myself.
