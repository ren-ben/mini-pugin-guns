<b>Project Guns</b> is a Test Project for learning Minecraft Plugins
   
# Description👀

This is a test plugin, meaning I don't really intend it for the public use, the "Mini Plugin" series is for me to play around in both Spigot and Github. Though, feel free to download and test my Plugins! Even if it isn't intended for public use
   
# Requirements🔥

1. Java 17 ☕

2. Minecraft 1.18.1👀
   
# Installation🕹️

1. Create A Server
   
   1. Download [Spigot](https://getbukkit.org/get/bf7ac3b5bc08ea97d22919680d240a80)
   
   2. Make a new folder
   
   3. Paste and rename the Spigot file to `spigot.jar`
   
   4. Make a new text file and paste in 
      
      `@echo off
      java -Xms3G -Xmx3G -jar spigot.jar -nogui
      pause`
   
   5. Save as start.bat and open it
   
   6. Open the newly created file `eula.txt` and change eula to **true**
   
   7. Run start.bat again

2. Download the jar file

3. Paste the jar file into the `plugins` Folder

4. Run start.bat one more time

# Basic Premise🪄


The Plugin, as I already stated isn't really for public use I just made it to train my skills a Git.

The Player will be given a command to weaponize certain Tools with certain Projectiles.

- Diamond Hoe launches Fireballs

- Iron Hoe launches XP Bottles

- Diamond Shovel launches Ender Pearls

- Iron Shovel launches Snowballs

- Diamond Sword launches Tridents

- Iron Sword launches Arrows

# Usage💡


Type `/w` to weaponize all the Tools

You can also specify which one you'd like to weaponize, for example `/w iron_shovel`

Here's a list of all the specific tool arguments:

- `diamond_hoe`

- `iron_hoe`

- `diamond_shovel`

- `iron_shovel`

- `diamond_sword`

- `iron_sword`

You can also use `/w rm` to de-weaponize all tools

This project is actually a challenge from [This Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/develop-minecraft-plugins-java-programming/) on Udemy made by Stephen King, all credit for the initial idea goes to him, although I've added some extra features myself.
